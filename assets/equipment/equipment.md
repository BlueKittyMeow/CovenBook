APPENDIX B: SPECIALIZED LABORATORY EQUIPMENT
# B.1 STANDARD EQUIPMENT
This section details the specialized equipment used throughout the standard laboratory curriculum. All students should familiarize themselves with proper handling and maintenance procedures.


1. Resonance Frequency Analyzer (RFA-103)
Measures vibrational patterns across multiple wavelengths. Essential for experiments in Units 1-3.
2. Quantum State Observer (QSO)
Detects and records particle behavior at the subatomic level. Used primarily in Unit 2 laboratories.
3. Harmonic Oscillation Chamber
Controlled environment for wave experiments requiring precise atmospheric conditions.
4. Digital Integration Interface (DI-7)
Connects standard computing devices to laboratory equipment for data collection and analysis.
5. Pattern Recognition Array
Optical system for documenting and analyzing visual energy signatures.

# B.2 ADVANCED EQUIPMENT (Departmental Authorization Required)

1. Symbolic Resonance Amplifier (SRA-Ω)
Enhances and directs intentional energy patterns through specialized crystal matrices. Used exclusively in Unit 5 laboratories.
2. Digital Manifestation Grid
Self-contained field generator for safely practicing manifestation techniques within a controlled environment. Prevents unintended external effects.
3. Character Transmutation Array
Converts digital symbolic inputs into corresponding energy patterns. Requires special calibration before each use.
4. Prismatic Amplification Chamber
Specialized enclosure containing natural amplification crystals for advanced energy work. Handle with extreme care.
5. Technomagic Safety Grid
Emergency containment system capable of neutralizing unstable manifestations. Present in all advanced laboratories.
